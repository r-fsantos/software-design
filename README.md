## Software Design
---
### About

This repo purpose is to develop my coding and design skills, practice software development/engineering skills and keep really sharpened on it.

At the moment of creation of this initiative, I'm on my first job as Software Engineer. The stack of the company is python. So, because of that,
it really makes sense to me focus on practicing the concepts that I will explore here using python language, at least on the beggining of it.

In order to acomplish that aims, I basically introduces some code (classes, functions, and even some full apps), and then refactor all of them to achieve
the practice goal. In the process, I do some very granular and descritive commits. For myself in the future and even someone that may ending up here.

My GitFlow it is very simple: Bacically a create a branch for every topic, and when the work is done, I open a PR (add some useful description, learnings, 
whatever makes sense for the posterity) close it by merging the branch into the master one.

That's all for now, folks. Enjoy it.
